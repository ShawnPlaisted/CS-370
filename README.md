## Pirate Intelligent Agent – CS 370 Portfolio Submission  
**Student:** Shawn Plaisted  
**Course:** CS 370 – Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science  
**Institution:** Southern New Hampshire University  

### Overview
This project uses reinforcement learning to train a pirate agent to navigate a maze and reach a treasure. The Jupyter Notebook in this repository contains the working model, training process, and game visualization that demonstrates my pirate agent successfully completing its task.

### Reflection

For this project, I worked on designing a pirate agent that could learn to navigate a maze and reach a piece of treasure. I was given starter code that included the maze setup, the reinforcement learning structure, and functions that allowed the agent to move and receive rewards. The code I created myself involved completing the deep Q learning model, training the pirate agent, running the tests, and showing the maze results once the model was finished learning.

Computer scientists solve problems using logic, experimentation, and creativity. They build tools and systems that help make life easier and support important real world technology. Throughout this course, I learned how artificial intelligence can improve through experience instead of being given exact instructions. Working through errors, testing different parameters, and seeing the model get smarter helped me better understand how intelligent agents behave and learn over time.

Completing this project also showed me that being a computer scientist includes ethical responsibilities. Even though this project used a simple maze, the same ideas are used in bigger technologies like robotics and autonomous vehicles. Those systems need to be designed carefully to avoid harm and protect people. Privacy, fairness, and transparency all matter when building software that interacts with real users. I will keep those responsibilities in mind as I continue developing more advanced projects in the future.
